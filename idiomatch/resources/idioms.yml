- etymology: From halcyon , from Latin Alcyone , from Ancient Greek Ἀλκυόνη ( Alkuónē
    ) , daughter of Aeolus and wife of Ceyx . When her husband died in a shipwreck,
    Alcyone threw herself into the sea whereupon the gods transformed them both into
    halcyon birds (kingfishers). When Alcyone made her nest on the beach, waves threatened
    to destroy it. Aeolus restrained his winds and kept them calm during seven days
    in each year, so she could lay her eggs. These became known as the "halcyon days,"
    when storms do not occur. Today, the term is used to denote a past period that
    is being remembered for being happy and/or successful.

    popularized by baseball commentator Red Barber, and often referred to baseball.
    The expression, according to James Thurber, comes from the observation of the
    catbird (an Australian bird) of the family Ptilonorhynchidae. Some of the male
    birds will assemble several hundred colored rocks or shells, arranging them in
    a remarkable artistic display, in order to build a "seat" atop which his mate
    will eventually be enthroned.

- etymology: From Mickey , a diminutive of the given name Michael , + mouse , referring
    to the species of the character. The name Mickey Mouse was coined by American
    animator Walt Disney in 1928 after his wife, Lillian Disney, persuaded him to
    change the character's original name Mortimer Mouse to Mickey , deeming the former
    too formal for the playful character. "Mickey" was suggested by Lillian, who preferred
    its more approachable and lively sound. The adjective sense developed during the
    Second World War, after a large quantity of low-quality counterfeit Mickey Mouse
    watches flooded the UK.

    against the Replie of T. C. , a 1574 pamphlet by John Whitgift ( Archbishop of
    Canterbury from 1583 to 1604). Made popular and particularly known from the title
    of the 1598 comedy play Much Ado About Nothing by William Shakespeare. Shakespeare
    had earlier used ado ( “ business, activity ” ) in the play Romeo and Juliet (1592)
    "Weele keepe no great adoe , a Friend or two.", though it is now frequently used
    to mean fuss as a contraction of the phrase here; nothing in the title of the
    play is a wordplay which can also mean noting ( “ to notice ” ) besides the usual
    meaning of nothing.

- etymology: Unknown; many unproven and widely debated theories exist. One of the
    most plausible is that it comes from Yiddish הצלחה און ברכה ( hatslokhe un brokhe
    , “ success and blessing ” ) through the heavy Ashkenazi Jewish influence in the
    American theater, via the misinterpretation in German as Hals- und Beinbruch (
    “ neck and leg fracture ” ) . The Yiddish phrase itself comes from Hebrew הַצְלָחָה
    וּ בְרָכָה ( hatzlakhá u-v'rakhá , “ success and blessing ” ) . Another possible
    origin was to wish opposite luck on the performer so as not to jinx the statement.

  senses:

    examples: []
  source: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/the_wheels_fell_off
- etymology: The phrase doesn’t have one particular origin, nor does it represent
    one particular metaphor. Instead, it seems to have evolved from a sense of yard
    meaning a vague quantity of something. Later, the words full or whole were attached
    to it, and even later it was quantified by the numbers six and nine , with the
    whole nine yards eventually winning out and becoming the canonical form. Use of
    the full phrase was for a long time restricted to the American Midwest, in particular
    to the region around the Kentucky-Indiana border, before breaking out into general
    American parlance in the middle of the twentieth century. [...] So regardless
    of what someone else has told you, the whole nine yards does not refer to the
    length of a belt of WWII machine-gun ammunition, the amount of material needed
    to make a Scottish kilt or a sari, the number of spars on a sailing ship, the
    amount of concrete a cement mixer holds, or anything else.
  lemma: the whole nine yards

- etymology: The phrase comes from nineteenth-century vaudeville theatres and refers
    to the cheap seats at the back of the theatre or in the upper balcony. It came

    Doody Show associated "peanut gallery" specifically with children.

- etymology: Originally as chestnut, with “old” for emphasis. Popularized US 1880s,
    particularly Northeast and Midwest, with various theories propounded. A commonly
    cited theory, viewed by the Oxford English Dictionary as “plausible” and cited
    by Brewer’s, is that it was coined by Boston comedic actor William Warren Jr.,
    quoting from 1816 English melodrama The Broken Sword by William Dimond. One of
    the characters in the play is a boor, and when once recounting a tale mentions
    a cork tree, which is corrected by the character Pablo as “A chestnut. I have
    heard you tell the tale these 27 times.” This line was then apparently quoted
    at a dinner party by Warren in response to a boor there, and proved popular. Note
    that William Warren Sr. had previously played Pablo on stage, but died in 1832,
    so the phrase was presumably popularized by the son, William Warren Jr.

- etymology: The origins of this phrase are uncertain, but it has been observed in
    print since at least 1693, and likely was around well before that. The possibly
    related phrase to a tittle is found in a 1607 play, The Woman Hater by Francis
    Beaumont and John Fletcher ("I'll quote him to a tittle"). The T in the phrase
    to a T is likely the first letter of a word, with tittle being the most likely
    source. Other theories with little evidence point to golf tees, for their small
    size; this may have at least influenced the alternative form to a tee. Some speculate
    a relationship with T-square, a measuring device introduced around the turn of
    the century. Others claim the expression refers to the correct completion of the
    letter t by crossing it. In print from "Two Years Before the Mast" published in
    1840, and, even then, using quotes, refers to the practice of squaring up a yardarm
    with a mast on a sailing ship such that it made a perpendicular T.

- etymology: Originally from a French poem Roman de Fauvel, written in the early 1300s;
    Fauvel was a conniving stallion, and the play was a satire on the corruption of
    social life. The name Fauvel points to the French fauve ("chestnut, reddish-yellow,
    or fawn"), another sense of fauve meaning the class of wild animals whose coats
    are at least partly brown, and the medieval belief that a fallow horse was a symbol
    of deceit and dishonesty. The phrase curry Fauvel, then, referred to currying
    ("combing") the horse, and was altered (as folk etymology) by later speakers to
    curry favor.

- etymology: The earliest known attestation is in late 18th century United States,
    in response to a toast made to “the United States” instead of to “the people of
    the United States”. In the early twentieth century the term was associated with
    the dogmatic application of Stalinist and Communist Party doctrine, and later
    popularised by Mao Zedong in his 1963 essay Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?
    which equated 'correct' with 'the disciplined acceptance of a party line'. In
    the 1970s it was adopted by wider left-wing politics. The first known use in this
    sense was by Toni Cade in her 1970 anthology The Black Woman. It was subsequently
    used in a statement by Karen DeCrow in December 1975 in her capacity as president
    of the National Organization for Women. In the 1980s it acquired the pejorative
    sense when used to mock conformist liberal academics, their stereotypical political
    views and alleged attempts to control language.

- etymology: 'Unclear. As an idiom, identified only in Australian and New Zealand
    English. Originally a sailing term for when the ship is taking in water and the
    ship is literally being bailed out to stay afloat. In the days of yore, the crew
    had to work 24 hours a day pumping out the ship until the ship reaches safe harbour
    for repairs. Also possibly as a punishment. Also suggested has been an origin
    in the construction industry: Workers can be quite literally under the pump if
    a concrete pour is occurring and the steel reinforcing and form-work is still
    being finished. The concrete pump would be reaching out above the workers, who
    would be completing their duties at a frantic pace. Once the concrete has been
    delivered, the ‘pour′ must occur as soon as possible, or it may begin to set.
    Hence, being under the pump describes the situation of working at feverish pace
    to meet a specific deadline.'

    used in satirical or jocular expressions, before developing a fixed association

    by essayist William Hazlitt in the 19th century.'

- etymology: Attested since 1922, of unclear origin. There are several suggested origins,
    but it most likely arose in imitation of the numerous animal-related nonsense
    phrases popular in the 1920s such as the cat's pyjamas , cat's whiskers , cat's
    meow , gnat's elbow , monkey's eyebrows etc. A popular folk etymology has the
    phrase referring to the world champion dancer Bee Jackson. Another suggestion
    is that the phrase is a corruption of business. The singular bee's knee is attested
    from the late 18th century meaning something small or insignificant in the phrase
    big as a bee's knee. Also as weak as a bee's knee is attested in Ireland (1870).
    It is possible that the bee's knees is a deliberate inversion of this meaning
    but is not attested. Another possibility is that this is a reference to the (visible)
    blobs of pollen in bees' corbiculae.
  lemma: the bee's knees
  senses:
  - content: Something or someone excellent, surpassingly wonderful, or cool.
    examples: []
  source: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/the_bee's_knees
- etymology: Popularized by US President Harry Truman. The phrase is based on the
    metaphorical expression passing the buck, derived from poker gameplay, that came

  lemma: the buck stops here
  senses:
  - content: A statement that no excuses will be made, that the speaker is going to

- etymology: Need is a noun, be a subjunctive. Perhaps an alteration of Old English
    phrases like ġif þearf bēo , literally “if need be.” That phrase would have been
    completely unidiomatic, equivalent to “if a need exists ” or “if there is a need.”
    This is because (1) Old English had no indefinite article, (2) the word for "to
    be" was also the default word for "to exist" and translates the modern phrase
    "there is," and (3) the subjunctive mood was much more common and often translates
    the Modern English indicative.
